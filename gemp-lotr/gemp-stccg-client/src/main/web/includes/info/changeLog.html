<b>2023 June 24</b>
- Fixed some bugs nobody asked to be fixed
- Fixed Questions That Need Answering and Risk a Little Light revealing what cards were returned to the deck in the chat log.
- Fixed Mirror of Galadriel revealing cards rather than looking at them.
- Fixed Very Nice Friends discarding your hand after reconcile, meaning you played a Shadow round with a 0-card hand (lol)
- Added log output recording what decision the Freeps player makes when staying/moving, and added start/end of turn and start/end of phase entries for tracking when progress is made.

<b>2023 June 23</b>
- Fixed tables crashing and persisting if a player timed out during preparation

<b>2023 June 22</b>
- Updating replay summaries to version 2, which now records a game's timing choice and the furthest site reached by each player.
- Fixing Shoulder to Shoulder not being blocked properly by Final Strike.  

This has changed how you interact with STS; it will no longer show a popup and just go straight to the exertion choice, which will permit both dwarves and elves and heal a companion of the appropriate race based on which one you exerted.

The STS PC errata has also been altered to use the same lack of popup for consistency, although it cannot be affected by Final Strike.
- Fixed Namarie errata always self-discarding and never removing a token instead if available.

<b>2023 June 09</b>
- Fixing some cut errata card images showing up.

<b>2023 June 08</b>
- The final errata batch before the 2023 World Championship has been issued.  <a href="https://blog.lotrtcgpc.net/2023/06/06/june-2023-errata-final-batch-before-the-wc/">Full details in this blog post.</a>

<b>2023 June 04</b>
- Fixing Hobbit Appetite working on allies

<b>2023 May 19</b>
- Fixed Terrible as the Dawn PC errata not working on a wounded Galadriel.
  
<b>2023 May 13 C</b>
- NEW FEATURE: Added a pair of "Removed From Game" piles next to the Adventure Decks, which contain the cards that each player has removed from the game.  This information is public and viewable by both your opponent and spectators.
- NEW FEATURE: Public Discard Pile support.  In formats which have this option enabled, discard piles are public information, meaning you can inspect your opponent's discard pile at any time.  All PC formats have been updated to enable this option.
- NEW FEATURE: Post-game deck inspection has been enabled.  Have you ever wondered what would have happened if you had drawn just one more card, or have you ever wondered where all your Nazgul were hiding?  After a game has ended, you can now click on your deck to inspect all cards which remain, in the same order that they were when the game ended.  The first card is the one on the top, and the last card the one on the bottom.  This is also enabled in replays, but will only work on replays recorded from now onward.
- PC formats update: all PC formats now end the game at the end of the Regroup phase and not the start.  This grants the Shadow player one last shot to play any Regroup actions (Isenorcs, Gleaming in the Snow, etc).  
 
<b>2023 May 13 B</b>
- Fixed sealed and draft formats choking on card ownership when it comes to cards which were reprinted in multiple sets (i.e. The Ruling Ring and Hobbit Sword)

<b>2023 May 13 A</b>
- NEW FEATURE: Private tables.  When the "Private" checkbox is checked, nobody (except admins) will be able to spectate your match.  Practice strategies for the World Championship safe from prying eyes!
- Fixed the long-standing adventure deck bug.  You should now be able to properly inspect your adventure deck during the match.
- Fixed a long-standing bug that caused cards in the discard pile (and dead pile and adventure deck) to appear super tiny the first time you opened the window.

- When automatically applying PC errata to a deck, foil cards now preserve their foiliness

<b>2023 April 7</b>

<b>2023 March 28</b>

<b>2023 March 18</b>
- Fixing card importer failing in certain cases where the "x2" or whatever came after the card name
- Altered the Blitz action timeout from 3 -> 5 minutes.  This will be reverted when the chess clock timer is visible in a future update, but for now this should reduce occurences of games ending during long, tense assignment phases, etc.
- Overhaul to the replay system.  These changes are all invisible and won't affect how replays themselves play out, but individual actions now have a timestamp attached to them, which will permit for real-time replay playback in the future.  Additionally, every replay file now has the full deck lists of each player included, which will make replay analysis much more accurate for inclusion rates in the future.
- Added json summary generation to the end of each replay process, which automates one portion of the replay analysis.
   
<b>2023 March 11</b>
- Fixed Horn of Boromir errata image showing the incorrect twilight cost.
- Tweaked wording of the Savagery to Match Their Numbers errata (no change to functionality)
- Hopefully fixing Terrible as the Dawn errata not working at all
- Minor back-end fixes
   
<b>2023 March 09</b>
- Added the ability for administrators to reset user passwords upon request.  No password reset request will be honored unless the individual can prove ownership of the account--usually by reciting the name of one or more decks on that account.

<b>2023 February 26</b>
- Fixing CSS in the main hall when a player's name is ridiculously long

<b>2023 February 19</b>
- Fixed the Hollowing of Isengard errata not correctly offering 5 twilight if an Orc was discarded
- Fixed players with a name longer than 10 characters being unignorable

<b>2023 February 12</b>

- Added competitive format stats to the Server Info tab, and added a new column showing how a casual/competitive format compares to all games

<b>2023 January 05</b>
- Added support for errata to sealed leagues
- New errata: Rivendell Gateway (V1_59) now has a "limit +6" to prevent an unlimited loop with Boromir, Defender of Minas Tirith.
   
<b>2023 January 02</b>
- Minor CSS adjustments
- Fixed the deckbuilder card importer not handling lines with a "1x" or "x1" on them, which resulted in sites and the RB not importing correctly
- Fixed the Palantir of Orthanc errata not putting the revealed card on the top of the deck
- Fixed the Erkenbrand's Horn errata missing its skirmish action
- Added support for V1-based starter decks and their appropriate images
   
<b>2023 January 01</b>
- Fixed an infinite loop causing game crashes with the Foul Things errata.
- Fixed the Neekerbreeker's Bog errata not having the <b>marsh</b> keyword.
- Fixed the White Arrows errata permitting exertion of an exhausted minion
- Fixed non-errata Mirror of Galadriel not properly selecting a single card
   
<b>2022 December 31</b>
- Minor fixes to the errata for Mirror of Galadriel and Curse Their Foul Feet
   
<b>2022 December 30</b>
- Fixed playtest Neekerbreeker's Bog being optional
- Fixed playtest Galadriel's Silver Ewer being unplayable
- Removed the rule-breaking convenience action which was added to the Decipher Realm of Dwarrowdelf some time ago

Playtest balance changes: 
- Greatest Kingdom of My People nerfed: limited to once per turn
- His Cruelty and Malice reworked: Now discards a [sauron] minion to reveal the top 2 cards of the FP draw deck. If 1 or more is FP, Shadow can exert a companion, unless FP discards all revealed FP cards.
- Far-seeing Eyes nerfed: back to unique it goes
- Ancient Emnity nerfed: now only heals 1 Elf and only requires 1 card discarded from Shadow's hand to prevent
- Flaming Brand reworked: now can be activated to get the old +2/damage+1 bonus, but the self-discard doesn't kick in until Regroup. You thus still "light and burn" the brand, but it works through Fierce skirmishes.
- Saruman, Keeper of Isengard buffed: his uruk-saving ability now can be activated by exerting or discarding Saruman (once he's exhausted). This lets you ditch him during a site so that a double doesn't have a useless vestigial Saruman dangling around.
- Savagery to Match Their Numbers reworked: twilight cost 0 -> 2, and if there are 5 companions then it grants +4 strength now and +2 strength later.
- Hunt Them Down buffed: twilight cost 3 -> 2
- Foul Things buffed: now lets you pull any [moria] card from discard, not just minions
- Beneath the Mountains has an added ability "Fellowship: Spot a Dwarf to discard the top 3 cards of your draw deck." On Gemp, this ability lets you choose how many times to invoke it so it does them all at once instead of lagging for your opponent.
- Realm of Dwarrowdelf now lets you discard up to 30 cards per use, in 3 card increments (so Shadow doesn't have to pass-pass-pass after each use)
- Ever My Heart Rises now has text showing the previously-hidden "Discard 5 cards from your draw deck" helper ability.  As noted above, this is now an errata that only works on PC versions and not the Decipher one.

<b>2022 December 28</b>
- Fixed playtest Not Feared In Sunlight only applying the -4 strength to Nazgul currently in play (i.e. none of them, since it's a Fellowship action)
- Fixed playtest Cavern Entrance being non-optional, and only applying to the owner of the site (whether FP or Shadow)

Playtest balance changes: 
- Scaling Ladder: buffed to permit each token's healing to be independent, meaning you can stack the healing on the same Uruk multiple times.

<b>2022 December 27</b>
- Created the Masterwork Selection Pack to be used for rewards.  It permits the owner to choose 1 of any Decipher or PC Masterwork card to be added to their collection.
- Fixed the PC Promo Selection Pack having a blurry image

<b>2022 December 25</b>
- Fixed Sam, of Bagshot Row (V1_54) having the default 6 resistance instead of 5
- A New Light, both Decipher and PC errata, fixed to restore the "if you do" clause being respected
- Added support for leagues being able to permit players to match against the same person multiple times.  Updated the Yuletide Leagues to permit rematches up to 3 times per serie.
   
<b>2022 December 23</b>
- Fixed Cirdan errata counting [Elven] events that were in the Shadow discard pile
- Fixed playtest Hollowing of Isengard being unique when it shouldn't be
   
<b>2022 December 22</b>
- Fixed Grond errata discarding even if a support area card was targeted
- Fixed playtest Band of the Eye being mandatory instead of optional
- Fixed playtest His Cruelty and Malice being unable to trigger
- Fixed playtest Greatest Kingdom of My People not being optional

Playtest balance changes: 

- Malice: reworked to be a Maneuver event instead of Archery event (else Cave Troll's Chain could be pulled from discard, preventing Freeps from being offered the chance to skip the phase)

<b>2022 December 21</b>
- <span style="color:red">Added 65 new errata across all PC formats.</span> <a href="https://blog.lotrtcgpc.net/2022/12/15/2022-yuletide-errata-patch-notes/">Detailed changelog can be found here</a>.

- Added the Help -> PC Errata screen, which will show all existing PC Errata with a handy screen for comparing the changes
- Added support for set V1 cards to the Deckbuilder import function
- Added support for set V1 and PC errata cards in the deck sharing screen
- Overall improvements to the deck import flexibility
- Altered default behavior of the “Spectate” button to open in a new tab
- Added a reminder to users to refresh the game hall after they save their deck
- Fixed Dwarven Axe (1C9) not respecting the Decipher ‘clarification’ (it will now only discard at most 1 card per skirmish, regardless of the number of minions defeated)
- Fixed the automatic chat scroll lock snapping to the bottom when the chat log was very long
- Added chat height to the site cookies, meaning that when you refresh the screen the game hall chat will remember what height you set it to last

   
<b>2022 November 20</b>
- Added a link to the wiki's Advanced Card Search in the deckbuilder
- Removed the "are you sure" nag prompt when opening packs.
- Added support for pressing ESC to dismiss card pack windows

<b>2022 November 10</b>
- Fixed the following cards having faulty images:
   - Depart Silently (3C31) (added "until the regroup phase" to the strength clause)
   - Worn Battleaxe (13C102) (added "Bearer must be a [Men] man")
   - Rider’s Bow (13U135) (fixed the item class being "Ranged" instead of "Ranged Weapon")
   - Doors of Durin (13U190) (removed the unnecessary "until the regroup phase" clause)
   - Grieving the Fallen (15U81) (changed to "Bearer must be a companion (except the Ring-bearer)")
   
The behavior of these cards has not changed, we have just altered the image to match what was already coded.  This is Decipher's fault and not ours; they failed to update the images on their website to match the actual prints.

<b>2022 November 09</b>
- Fixed a crash occurring when a sealed event attempted to issue its product for a new serie.

<b>2022 November 07</b>
- Fixed a typo in the prompt given to a player for Rivendell Gateway (V1_59).  The behavior hasn't changed, just what prompt is displayed for the user.

<b>2022 November 04</b>
- Fixed the merchant not permitting the purchasing of foils
- Fixed the merchant requiring you to do everything twice for it to register
- Fixed various errors in merchant operations
- Fixed decks not loading for players with a Hobbit deck in their collection

<b>2022 November 04 - Hobbit Fixes by Phallen</b>
- The Hobbit's "Bilbo, Master of Riddles" is now properly strength +2 when skirmishing Smaug
- Added "The Hobbit Draft Game" to the game hall, which allows decks to be constructed for The Hobbit across all of its expansions
- "The Hobbit Draft Game" is also available in the deckbuilder to properly validate decks in the format
- Added remaining cultures for The Hobbit to the deckbuilder, and set them to only appear when "The Hobbit Sets" or one of its expansions is selected

<b>2022 November 03</b>
- Fixed some players not being able to create tables
- Fixed player gold count being incorrect; added 200 to everyone's totals for the trouble (not that it matters)
- Fixed decks with foil or tengwar cards not showing up properly in the deck sharing view

<b>2022 November 02</b>
COLLECTION SYSTEM OVERHAUL
- major back-end rewrite of the collection system, which is now stored in the database properly
- As a result, collections can now be modified if errors occur
- Thus, the Isildur/Gimli snafu has finally been repaired, and 4x copies of each card have been issued to the correct players.  Anyone who put the Gimli Masterwork into a deck should check and make sure it's not Isildur.
- Added *tons* of logging to all operations.  As a result, mysterious bugs are now far easier to track down for the future.
- Improved the ability for moderators to track suspicious league cheaters

<b>2022 September 12</b>
- Revamped several back-end systems to be hot-reloadable. What this means is, any future changes to formats, packs, draft or sealed events, or card definitions can all be pushed and updated without requiring a server restart, even mid-game. Certain bugfixes should be deployed much faster now! 
- Major overhaul to the sealed event and pack definition systems; look out for new Sealed event types coming soon!
- Added a resize handle to the chat window in the game hall so it can be manually resized.
- Added right-click as an alternative to shift+click when zooming in on cards; no more shakey shift fingers causing misclicks!
- Adjusted the text color for system announcements so it's more readable
- Updated the hall UI to use the latest version of JQuery. 
- Added a favicon to the site and revamped window titles. 
- Fixed game chat (and more rarely hall chat) not scrolling all the way to the bottom when first connecting.
- Fixed chat message links not opening in a new tab
- Improved log accessibility

<b>2022 August 29</b>
- Migrated all admin management scripts into a dedicated (hidden) tab
- Added admin command to hot reload JSON card definitions.  As a result, in the future any changes made to cards that use the new-style definitions will be able to have fixes pushed without requiring a server restart.  For now this means cards in sets 0, 1, 9, 14, 16, 19, V1, and a smattering of other cards.  Eventually the PC will have a dedicated push to convert all cards to JSON so they will be supported by this system.
- Fixed Galadriel, Lady of the Golden Wood (3R17) errata accidentally requiring an orc to play

<b>2022 August 26</b>
- fixed slash commands not working in chat
- added a warning if an invite-only table is made for a user that doesn't exist
- fixed the CoC not rendering properly
- Combined the chopped-up help messages so that spam is avoided (as html can just be used now)
- fixed league games being eligible for custom descriptions (this breaks anonymity)

<b>2022 August 25</b>
- GEMP Hall UI overhaul, including:
- Full dark mode on all browsers
- Markdown support in chat (no aliased URLs or images)
- Added automatic linking of bare URLs
- Multi-line support in chat with shift + click
- Chat now highlights when a user is mentioned, in yellow unless pinged with @, in which case it highlights with red
- Added support for @everyone and @anyone mentions
- Added table descriptions
- Added Invite-only tables (set the description to the name of the player you want to restrict the table to, check the Invite-only box, and nobody but them can join)
- Chat Lock box removed.  Instead the scrollbar controls this behavior (locked when scrolled down to 95% or more of the distance, unlocked otherwise)
- Added an action bar of items to the top of the screen, and moved Deck Builder and Merchant there 
- Crossed out the Merchant link to hopefully better communicate that it's a deprecated feature
- Consolidated tabs into groups
- The Server Stats subtab now automatically pushes the date back a month and runs it for you once when navigating to it
- The entire hall is now written in proper CSS.  As a result, you can zoom in and out without getting pre-empted
- <a href="https://blog.lotrtcgpc.net/2022/08/26/25-august-2022-gemp-patch-hall-ui-rework/">Full blog post detailing this UI Overhaul here.</a>

- BUFFED: Madril, Defender of Osgiliath (15R64)
   Game Text:

- Added Notes to decks.  Click the + button in the deckbuilder to edit notes, which you can use to leave notes for yourself.

<b>2022 August 05</b>
- MASSIVE back-end update.
   - Upgraded Java version from 8 to 17

 but ALL problems with the deck will now show instead of just one.  In addition, the 
 format will show in the deck listing, both in the deckbuilder and in the main hall.
- All decks default to the Anything Goes format, so you'll have to spend some time 
 associating each deck with the proper format.
- Increased deck name limit to 100 characters
- Edited decks now highlight their title in orange with a * in front (to facilitate
 much longer deck names pushing the " - edited" post-script off the screen).

<b><i>Several changes below have wide impact.</i></b>  If you notice any issues at all, please do not hesitate to report them <a href="https://forms.gle/ewAuxFPJqUHwHJCa9">on this form here.</a>

General Changes:

- Fixed Halls of My Home (1C18) not rearranging cards in the Shadow deck
- Fixed A Wizard Is Never Late (1R87) not being able to be played if there are no [Gandalf] cards in the draw deck.  Other cards with such behavior will need fixed on a case-by-case basis, so report them if you see any.
- Fixed Asfaloth (1U31) not paying twilight when transfered to another character.  Other Free Peoples cards with a self-discount like this likely had the same behavior, but should have been fixed with this.
- Fixed Grond, Hammer of the Underworld (8R103) PC Errata self-discarding if it was used to discard a card attached to a card in the support area (such as Vilya on an Elrond ally).
- Fixed Caves of Aglarond Decipher clarification image being rotated
- Added a message to chat when a player chooses to skip assigning
- Adding experimental chat output for when a card's effect adds keywords.
   In particular, this should allow the errata'd Saruman, Keeper of Isengard (3R68) to indicate which Uruk has been targeted.
- Fixed an infinite loop caused by cards attaching themselves to themselves
- Fixed minor verbiage issues with various card actions


<b>2022 July 12</b>
- Fixed Black Breath (1U207) highlighting itself incorrectly when there was a Ringwraith minion on the board (such as Bill Ferny) but no Nazgul.
- Fixed Ulaire Enquea, Duplicitous Lieutenant (17R140) triggering on any heals, even if they didn't come from the Free Peoples player (such as Dark Temptation)
- Due to the previous fix, had to overhaul the implementation for literally every card that heals.  If you notice anything strange around healing, please report it ASAP on the PC Discord
- Added promo images for the July PC Weekend League and distributed them to the participants/winners.


<b>2022 July 07</b>
- Added all non-hobbit sets to Anything Goes (including Playtest-only cards)
- Added the errata slash to "clarifications" that Decipher issued, as many of them are errata in disguise
- Updated all Decipher "clarifications" to have the clarified text (this had no changes to gameplay, as cards were already coded to use the modified text; this just, well, clarifies things)
- [PC FORMATS] Fixed Ulaire Nertea, Dark Horseman (19P38) errata not adding a burden like it's supposed to
- UPDATED ERRATA: Castamir of Umbar (8R51). 
   Game Text:
      Corsair. <span style="color:red">Enduring.</span>
      Shadow: Exert Castamir of Umbar and play a corsair to add 2 [RAIDER] tokens to a card that already has a [RAIDER] token on it. 
      
- UPDATED ERRATA: Corsair War Galley (8U59). 
   Game Text:
      When you play this possession, you may add a [RAIDER] token here. While you can spot <span style="color:red">6</span> [RAIDER] tokens here and a [RAIDER] Man, the Shadow has initiative, regardless of the Free Peoples player's hand.

      <b>Regroup:</b> Add (1) for each token here. Discard this possession. 

- UPDATED ERRATA: Great Hill Troll (8C102)
   Game Text:
      <b>Besieger.  Fierce.</b>

site.
- Tables in Game Hall now also display the name of the format.

- Most of the cards should now have animations when they affect other cards.

- I think I finally found and fixed the problem that caused the wounds not to be displayed sometimes on the client,

<b>23 Sept. 2011</b>
- If an action or effect has play card from non-deck zone as an effect or a cost, you have to have a playable card of
type in that zone before you start playing the action or effect. If you use an action or effect of that type, you HAVE
to choose a matching card and play it if possible, but only from cards that were in that zone when you started playing
that action or effect. Examples - you can't use Morgul Gates without playable Nazgul in hand and you HAVE to play it,
you can't discard 3 cards using They Are Coming without an Orc in discard, if you have an Orc and use it, the Orc you
play MAY NOT be one of those you discarded as a cost.

<b>22 Sept. 2011</b>
- Changed the main page after logging in to give access to additional documents.
- Changed the play event animation so that player might actually recognize the card.
- The animations are no longer shown to the player who initiated the effect, he should know what he played.
- Fixed Athelas and some other possessions, that could not be used during Fellowship phase if a valid transfer target
could be spotted. The problem was, that in that case there are 2 (or more) possible actions to do with 1 card. Now
a small context menu will show up in that case and user will be able to choose, which action to perform.

than being treated like damage in Magic.

sometimes.
