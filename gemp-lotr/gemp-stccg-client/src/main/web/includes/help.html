			<h1>Manual</h1>

			<p><i>Courtesy of Drachu84 (with further changes by MarcinS)</i></p>

			<p>GEMP-Lotr is an automatic game client for the Lord of the Rings Tradable Card Game. Below you will
				find basic information about using it.</p>

			<ol>
				<li><b>The Game Hall</b><br/>
					A place where everything starts. When you log in, you automatically enter Game Hall.
					Same thing happens when you win/lose game. Basically you can communicate here with
					other players, create decks, create and join games, etc.
				</li>

				<li><b>Building The Deck</b><br/>
					Making a deck is very easy. In the Game Hall you will find "Deck Builder" button. Simply click it and
					the deck builder will open. At the very top of the screen you will see buttons and other controls that allow you
					to manage your deck(s). You can create a new deck, save or rename currently edited one, or open an existing
					deck.<br/>
					The rest of the screen is divided into three parts. In the left one, you can choose Ring
					Bearer, The One Ring and Sites. To the right side you can find cards which could be added to your deck. Middle
					part is what actually your deck consists of.<br/>
					The right hand side allows you to filter the available cards by various criteria - set, name, culture, etc.
					You can select multiple criteria and all cards matching these will be displayed below. If there is more cards
					matching that could be displayed at one time, a next (and previous) page button above will allow you to browse
					other pages. Between the next and previous button you will find slider that allows to adjust the number of cards
					displayed on each page.<br/>
					The displayed card size makes it very difficult to read the card text, therefore you can zoom in on the card by
					pressing Shift+click on the card. The same option is available without any keyboard interaction by dragging the
					card
					in the "up" direction (press left mouse button on the card then without releasing the mouse button move your
					mouse up/forward,
					then release the mouse button). Once you're done with viewing the zoomed card, just click anywhere on the
					screen.<br/>
					Once you find a card you wish to add to your deck, just left-click it to move the card to your deck - in the
					center part of
					the screen. If you wish to remove a card from your deck, just left-click it. Your deck is split into two parts,
					one for each
					side - free people and shadow.<br/>
					Underneath the deck you will find information about the deck you're building/viewing - number of shadow and free
					people cards
					and if the deck is valid in supported formats. If the deck is not valid in some format, the information why it's
					not valid is available.
				</li>

				<li><b>Setting up game</b><br/>
					Once you have created the deck, you can start playing. You can create a new game by clicking on Create Table
					or join an existing table by clicking on Join Table. Each table displays the format the player wants to play,
					also when you create a table you have to select the format you wish to play from the first drop-down. When you
					create
					or join an existing table, you have to choose your deck from the second drop-down.<br/>
					Once there are two people at the table (one created the table, and one joined it) the game starts. Once the game
					starts other people might go over and view your game by clicking on Watch Game button.
				</li>

				<li><b>Playing game</b><br/>
					Playing Lord of the Rings TCG via Gemp is similar to the one played in real life. First you bid
					number of burdens to determine who goes first. If you win it, a window with "Choose a seat
					number at the table" will pop up. Number 1 means that you want to go first, number 2 that
					opponent will and so on.<br/>
					Depending on a format the first player might be asked to select first site, and both players might be asked
					to choose to mulligan or not (mulligan - shuffle your first hand of 8 cards back into deck and draw 6 cards).
					The mulligan option can be used only once per player in a game and only once, just after the first hand of 8
					cards is drawn.<br/>
					You need to choose your starting fellowship during each game. Select characters one-by-one by clicking on them
					for the
					total twilight cost up to 4 (selected character is the one with a blue frame on it).<br/>
					Time to play some cards! On the bottom part of the game you can find your starting hand.
					Click one time on the card to play it. Gemp automatically adds twilight points and triggers
					actions which are not optional (for example, playing A Wizard is never late will automatically
					let you choose a "Gandalf culture" character to play from the draw deck. However, the
					actions which may be used, are not played automatically (even it is obvious that you want
					to do it). If such action is available, affected card will be highlighted with green frame (for
					example Old Toby allows you to draw a card when you play it, but it needs to be clicked again
					for this action to happen, as it is optional). This applies to all other actions in all stages of the
					game.<br/>
					Below the frame with turn sequence there is a smaller one where you will find what
					you currently can do. In most cases cards eligible to play at the current moment will be
					highlighted. If you don’t want to do anything, click Pass and the next step will commence.<br/>
					The Settings tab allows you to change some basic settings of the game - whether to automatically pass if no
					phase
					actions are available to you or not, and also if each card/action selection has to be confirmed or not. It's
					highly
					recommended to de-select this checkbox if you're playing on touch-screen devices (phone/tablets) to prevent
					accidental
					card selection.
				</li>

				<li><b>Card stats</b><br/>
					Each character in game displays its current (or from time when it was last active) strength, vitality and the
					third stat (site number or resistance).
					If a character with base strength of 6 bears a weapon that gives +2 strength, the character will display 8 in
					its
					strength box. Please keep in mind that the weapon attached to it will also display the +2 bonus on it, but it
					should
					not be further added to the character strength, as the bonus is already applied. The same goes for every other
					bonus/penalty in the game and each stat.
				</li>

				<li><b>Player stats</b><br/>
					Next to the Adventure Path in game you can see each player name. To the right of the name you can find
					"chess-clock" for that player.
					This time measures time it took for that player to make decisions in game (like in chess). If the time for the
					player runs out, that
					player automatically concedes the game (loses). Directly below the player name you will see 3 icons with
					numbers, these represent: deck size,
					hand size and number of threats that player has. Also, next to them you will see an extra button with a plus (+)
					sign, that allows you
					to get extra data about that player's discard pile and dead pile sizes.<br/>
					You can browse your own or opponent's dead pile by clicking on the icon. You can do the same with your discard
					pile (but not your opponent's).
				</li>

				<li><b>Skirmish</b><br/>
					As a vital part of the game, skirmish at first may look complicated. However, when you get
					used to Gemp interface you will see its fast and user-friendly. For the beginners, few words
					on how it works.<br/>
					First you need to assign minions to companions. Click on the minion, then the companion
					you wish to fight him (eligible companions will be highlighted). Assigned minions and
					companions will appear to the right side of the game table. When you finish assigning, click
					Done. Before you do it, think if it is your final decision, because you won’t be able to assign
					them differently afterward.<br/>
					Next step is skirmish. Click on the character which you want to fight first. When that skirmish
					is complete, select another one and so on. Skirmish events, special abilities, etc. which are
					playable will be highlighted during every fight. If you don’t want to play any, click Pass.
					After all skirmishes are resolved (including fierce ones) game will proceed to next stage (Regroup or Assignment
					if there are any Fierce minions);)
				</li>

				<li><b>The Iron rule</b><br/>
					There is no rolling back, simple as that. You can’t undo an action that already happen, even if
					opponent will agree. If you played cards you didn’t want to, assigned wrong or didn’t trigger
					optional action it’s done and can’t be reversed. If you do mistakes like that often, you might consider
					unchecking
					the "Auto-accept after selecting action or card" checkbox in Settings tab.
				</li>

				<li><b>Useful Stuff</b><br/>
					On the upper part of the game hall, you will find many tabs with useful information. While it's
					not obligated, I recommend reading it.
				</li>

		<p>The Gemp-LotR sever is devoted to fans of Decipher’s Lord of the Rings Card Game. We want GEMP to be a place where
				everyone, regardless of who they are, can gather to socialize, talk, and play Lord of the Rings with like-minded
				people in a safe and welcoming environment. This is a family game and this is a family friendly server. In order
				to make that happen we have certain rules we ask all members of our community to adhere to. These rules will be
				vigorously enforced so that a handful of bad apples don't spoil it for everyone else.</p>
		<h1>Don't Cheat</h1>
		<p>Cheating includes but is not limited to the following:</p>
		<ul>
				<li><b>Gold Farming</b> - Creating multiple accounts to abuse the merchant system to the benefit of primary account
						decreases the value of everyone’s my-card collections. Don’t do it.</li>
				<li><b>Collusion (Game Fixing)</b> - Soliciting or agreeing with an opponent to end any ranked match in any way
						other than playing it to conclusion detracts from the integrity of the league or tournament.</li>
				<li><b>Exploiting the Sever</b> - Knowingly utilizing a system error or card bug to your advantage.</li>
				<li><b>Multiple Accounts</b> - Entering a league or tournament with multiple accounts is not acceptable. If you have
						more than one family member using your network contact MarcinS. Otherwise a member with multiple accounts found
						entering a league or tournament will have those accounts deleted.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Don't Be a Jerk</h1>
		<p>This rule trumps any other. Any loophole you think you've found in any other rule is covered by this one. If you make
				our server a less pleasant place to be, we don't want you here and we have no problem revoking your account.
				Here are a couple of the things you should stay away from:</p>
		<ul>
				<li><b>Flaming</b> - Calling people names, this includes calling others a troll.	Personal attacks are unacceptable.</li>
				<li><b>Rage Quitting</b> - Leaving a GEMP-LotR game without first hitting the concede button. It is found in the
						options tab of the chat window.</li>
				<li><b>Trolling</b> - Posting inflammatory, extraneous or off-topic messages with the primary intent of provoking
						readers into an emotional response or otherwise intentionally disrupting a game (even if that game is your own)</li>
				<li><b>Offensive language</b> - Please read what you wrote before you post it and think if anyone else could find
						it offensive, including but not limited to your standard 4-letter words. This also includes attacks against race,
						religion, culture, class, or sexuality.</li>
				<li><b>Rants</b> - You can disagree with whatever you like but using obscene language and/or a full CAPS chat
						is against our policies. We are sure you can find another way to voice your opinion without being aggressive,
						regardless of whom it is directed at.</li>
				<li><b>Ban Jumping</b> - If you create another account after being permanently banned, suspended or on probation,
						both of your accounts will be automatically banned.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>If you find someone is violating one of these rules, report them to TLHH and let the moderators do their job.
				Responding to a troll or someone who may have flamed you will only get you in trouble. Report, ignore and move
				on the community at large will be better for it.</p>
		<h1>Have Respect for Others</h1>
		<p>Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but no one is entitled to attack others for sharing, or not sharing,
				that opinion. If you can't communicate without using combative, aggressive, or demeaning language, then please
				keep those comments to yourself, or be shown the door. Deliberately inflammatory remarks in game chat or the game
				hall; statements written with the sole intention of irritating people; attacks toward or inappropriate commentary
				regarding GEMP-LotR staff, creators, or other players	will limit or remove your GEMP-LotR privileges.</p>
		<h1>Have Respect for the Site and its Content</h1>
		<p>MarcinS and others have put a lot of work into the content on the site, and if you've just shown up to trample on
				that hard work, we will ask you to leave. Constructive criticism is welcomed; negativity for its own sake is not.
				Further, discussions instructing or otherwise advocating the circumvention of Code of Conduct will not be tolerated.</p>
		<h1>Put Some Effort Into Your Communication</h1>
		<p>A well-written comment engages your opponent and the rest of the game hall and facilitates discussion. We ask that
				while in game hall or game chat you avoid posting about or linking to the following:</p>
		<ul>
				<li>Pedophilia</li>
				<li>Pornography</li>
				<li>Sexist, Racist or Perverted Remarks</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Penalties</h1>
		<p><small>(Keep in mind, that banning a user takes us less time, than it takes you to create a new one.)</small></p>
		<p>The penalty system is meant to provide guidance to users - it allows users to better understand the rules and adjust
				their conduct to conform to the expectations of the GEMP-LotR community which may differ from other Internet game
				sites. GEMP-LotR uses a strike system that grants you a maximum amount of 8 penalties to learn how to adhere to our
				server policies. Once a threshold has been broken, there is no way to gain strikes back. Here is the breakdown
				of all 8 stages:</p>
		<ul>
				<li><b>Up to 4 Warnings</b> - Warnings do not negatively impact your account but will stack against you for penalties.</li>
				<li><b>Probation</b> - This is your final warning. Once you receive probation, you are always on probation.
						All penalties after this will be suspensions.</li>
				<li><b>3-day Suspension</b> - You will be unable to log into	the site for three days.</li>
				<li><b>2-week Suspension</b> - You will be unable to log into for two weeks.</li>
				<li><b>Permanent Ban</b> - Your privilege to play Lord of the Rings on the site will be revoked permanently.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>We do not enjoy banning people, but we will not hesitate to do so if we think that a person's removal will have
				an overall positive effect on the community. We also reserve the right to increase the punishment as we see fit,
				and any punishment above a warning will put the user at a minimum on the probationary level.</p>
		<h1>Appeal System</h1>
		<p>Moderators and staff are human and sometimes make mistakes. For this reason, we have an appeal system that members
				can utilize to plead their case in hopes of a reversal of a penalty. Once you have received a penalty, you may
				appeal your penalty via private e-mail. Discussion of penalties/conduct or ranting against a suspension on TLHH
				forums will not advance your appellant case. If you choose to use the appeal system, please make sure to check your
				spam folder for an email.</p>
		<p>All appeals are normally seen within 48 hours of your appeal, except on weekends.</p>

					F.A.Q.
					<ol type="a">
							<li><b>Can I trade cards in a Sealed league?</b><br/>
									Cards in a Sealed League cannot be traded. The point of having a Sealed league is to provide players
									with limited (semi-random)
									access to card pool for building their deck. This, in theory, should give everyone fair chance of
									winning, based only on deck-building and play-skill.
							</li>
							<li><b>When will I get new boosters in a Sealed league?</b><br/>
									New product in a Sealed league is given at the beginning of each Serie. This is done automatically.
							</li>
							<li><b>How do I join a league?</b><br/>
									In "Leagues" tab click "See details" for the league you are interested in and then click on the "Join league" button.
									If you had enough currency in your account, you will be added to the league.
									In case of sealed league, you need to select the league collection in your deck builder
									(showing "All cards" by default) to build the deck. To open the packs you see there, just left-click
									them.

		<p>GEMP-Lotr is an automatic game client for the Lord of the Rings Tradable Card Game. Below you will
				find basic information about using it.</p>

		<ol>
				<li><b>The Game Hall</b><br/>
						A place where everything starts. When you log in, you automatically enter Game Hall.
						Same thing happens when you win/lose game. Basically you can communicate here with
						other players, create decks, create and join games, etc.
				</li>

				<li><b>Building The Deck</b><br/>
						Making a deck is very easy. In the Game Hall you will find "Deck Builder" button. Simply click it and
						the deck builder will open. At the very top of the screen you will buttons and other controlls that allow you
						to manage your deck(s). You can create a new deck, save or rename currently edited one, or open an existing
						deck.<br/>
						The rest of the screen is divided into three parts. In the left one, you can choose Ring
						Bearer, The One Ring and Sites. To the right side you can find cards which could be added to your deck. Middle
						part is what actually your deck consists of.<br/>
						The right hand side allows you to filter the available cards by various criteria - set, name, culture, etc.
						You can select multiple criteria and all cards matching these will be displayed below. If there is more cards
						matching that could be displayed at one time, a next (and previous) page button above will allow you to browse
						other pages. Between the next and previous button you will find slider that allows to adjust the number of cards
						displayed on each page.<br/>
						The displayed card size makes it very difficult to read the card text, therefore you can zoom in on the card by
						pressing Shift+click on the card. The same option is available without any keyboard interaction by dragging the
						card
						in the "up" direction (press left mouse button on the card then without releasing the mouse button move your
						mouse up/forward,
						then release the mouse button). Once you're done with viewing the zoomed card, just click anywhere on the
						screen.<br/>
						Once you find a card you wish to add to your deck, just left-click it to move the card to your deck - in the
						center part of
						the screen. If you wish to remove a card from your deck, just left-click it. Your deck is split into two parts,
						one for each
						side - free people and shadow.<br/>
						Underneath the deck you will find information about the deck you're building/viewing - number of shadow and free
						people cards
						and if the deck is valid in supported formats. If the deck is not valid in some format, the information why it's
						not valid is available.
				</li>

				<li><b>Setting up game</b><br/>
						Once you have created the deck, you can start playing. You can create a new game by clicking on Create Table
						or join an existing table by clicking on Join Table. Each table displays the format the player wants to play,
						also when you create a table you have to select the format you wish to play from the first drop-down. When you
						create
						or join an existing table, you have to choose your deck from the second drop-down.<br/>
						Once there are two people at the table (one created the table, and one joined it) the game starts. Once the game
						starts other people might go over and view your game by clicking on Watch Game button.
				</li>

				<li><b>Playing game</b><br/>
						Playing Lord of the Rings TCG via Gemp is similar to the one played in real life. First you bid
						number of burdens to determine who goes first. If you win it, a window with choose a seat
						number at the table will pop-up. Number 1 means that you want to go first, number 2 that
						opponent will and so on.<br/>
						Depending on a format the first player might be asked to select first site, and both players might be asked
						to choose to mulligan or not (mulligan - shuffle your first hand of 8 cards back into deck and draw 6 cards).
						The mulligan option can be used only once per player in a game and only once, just after the first hand of 8
						cards is drawn.<br/>
						You need to choose your starting fellowship during each game. Select characters one by one by clicking on them
						for the
						total twilight cost up to 4 (selected character is the one with a blue frame on it).<br/>
						Time to play some cards! On the bottom part of the game you can find your starting hand.
						Click one time on the card to play it. Gemp automatically adds twilight points and triggers
						actions which are not optional (for example, playing A Wizard is never late will automatically
						let you choose a "Gandalf culture" character to play from the draw deck. However the
						actions which may be used, are not played automatically (even it is obvious that you want
						to do it). If such action is available, affected card will be highlighted with green frame (for
						example Old Toby allows you to draw a card when you play it, but it needs to be clicked again
						for this action to happen, as it is optional). This applies to all other actions in all stages of the
						game.<br/>
						Below the frame with turn sequence there is a smaller one where you will find what
						you currently can do. In most cases cards eligible to play at the current moment will be
						highlighted. If you don’t want to do anything, click Pass and the next step will commence.<br/>
						The Settings tab allows you to change some basic settings of the game - whether to automatically pass if no
						phase
						actions are available to you or not, and also if each card/action selection has to be confirmed or not. It's
						highly
						recommended to de-select this checkbox if you're playing on touch-screen devices (phone/tablets) to prevent
						accidental
						card selection.
				</li>

				<li><b>Card stats</b><br/>
						Each character in game displays its current (or from time when it was last active) strength, vitality and the
						third stat (site number or resistance).
						If a character with base strength of 6 bears a weapon that gives +2 strength, the character will display 8 in
						its
						strength box. Please keep in mind that the weapon attached to it will also display the +2 bonus on it, but it
						should
						not be further added to the character strength, as the bonus is already applied. The same goes for every other
						bonus/penalty in the game and each stat.
				</li>

				<li><b>Player stats</b><br/>
						Next to the Adventure Path in game you can see each player name. To the right of the name you can find
						"chess-clock" for that player.
						This time measures time it took for that player to make decisions in game (like in chess). If the time for the
						player runs out, that
						player automatically concedes the game (loses). Directly below the player name you will see 3 icons with
						numbers, these represent: deck size,
						hand size and number of threats that player has. Also next to them you will see an extra button with a plus (+)
						sign, that allows you
						to get extra data about that player's discard pile and dead pile sizes.<br/>
						You can browse your own or opponent's dead pile by clicking on the icon. You can do the same with your discard
						pile (but not your opponent's).
				</li>

				<li><b>Skirmish</b><br/>
						As a vital part of the game, skirmish at first may look complicated. However, when you get
						used to Gemp interface you will see its fast and user friendly. For the beginners, few words
						on how it works.<br/>
						First you need to assign minions to companions. Click on the minion, then the companion
						you wish to fight him (eligible companions will be highlighted). Assigned minions and
						companions will appear to the right side of the game table. When you finish assigning, click
						Done. Before you do it, think if it is your final decision, because you won’t be able to assign
						them differently afterwards.<br/>
						Next step is skirmish. Click on the character which you want to fight first. When that skirmish
						is complete, select another one and so on. Skirmish events, special abilities, etc. which are
						playable will be highlighted during every fight. If you don’t want to play any, click Pass.
						After all skirmishes are resolved (including fierce ones) game will proceed to next stage (Regroup or Assignment
						if there are any Fierce minions);)
				</li>

				<li><b>The Iron rule</b><br/>
						There is no rolling back, simple as that. You can’t undo an action that already happen, even if
						opponent will agree. If you played cards you didn’t want to, assigned wrong or didn’t trigger
						optional action it’s done and can’t be reversed. If you do mistakes like that often, you might consider
						unchecking
						the "Auto-accept after selecting action or card" checkbox in Settings tab.
				</li>

				<li><b>Useful Stuff</b><br/>
						On the upper part of the game hall, you will find many tabs with useful information. Thus its
						not obligated, I recommend to read it.
				</li>
