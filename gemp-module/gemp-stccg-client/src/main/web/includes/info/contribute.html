    <h1>How can I help?</h1>
    <p>You can contribute in multiple ways:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            First, by playing!  The more people we have playing, the easier it is for anyone to find a match or get help.<br>
        </li>
        <li>
            If you are a programmer (or would like to be one), you can see GEMP's code base <a href="https://github.com/PlayersCouncil/gemp-lotr">on GitHub here</a>.  Pull requests are welcome.  Coordinate with Ketura on <a href="https://lotrtcgpc.net/discord">the PC Discord</a> if you are looking for specific tasks to perform.
        </li>

            If you're interested in playtesting, go to My Account -> Playtesting and opt-in.  This will give you access to three PLAYTEST formats, one each for PLAYTEST - Fellowship Block (PC), PLAYTEST - Movie Block (PC), and PLAYTEST - Expanded (PC).  
            <br><br>
            These formats have the latest untested errata and upcoming Virtual Sets from the Player's Council, and we can always use more people testing things out.<br>
        </li>
        <li>
            If you have ideas on cards that you think should be errata'd, or if you have Opinions on the PC's big gameplay initiatives, then <a href="https://lotrtcgpc.net/discord">come let us know on the PC Discord</a>.  We are always happy to hear people's proposals and hear your thoughts on our own ideas.<br>
        </li>
